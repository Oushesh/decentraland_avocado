## There are two ways here: we update our git automatically

## Or we do the same as was done before but instead I write a new bash script file:

## just now I use a bash script to run all the dcl language tests:

## write a script in python that will download the file in *.zip: extract
    1. Download the zip file using curl
    2. extract the downloaded file --> copy the contents to the models folder
    3. shutil
    4. then use bash script to automatically update the models: and thus update the git.

    5. Next time user wants to download the models he can do so:

    6. On the long run lets make the models should be served onto s3 storage. (serve the glb models on s3: then
    download them from server --> also for update we check the versioning of the files here:

    7. Automatic script to update on our side --> user gets it then clones the new git run the bash
       all sorted out.

## Idea is they have to clone it from our git then execute the bash line
